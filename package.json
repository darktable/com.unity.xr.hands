More information can be found on the [XR Hands Joint Processing](../manual/process-joints.md) manual page.\n- Added two samples to the Hand Visualizer sample for how to use the new Joint Processing feature to change the visual output of hand tracking.\n- `XRHand` and `XRHandJoint` both now implement `IEquatable`, and have `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, and the `==` and `!=` operators overloaded.\n- Added `XRHandTrackingEvents` component that subscribes to hand tracking events for a specific hand and surfaces Unity Events when the hand updates or tracking state changes.\n- Added `XRHandMeshController` component that subscribes to events from a `XRHandTrackingEvents` and can optionally show or hide a mesh.\n- Added `XRHandSkeletonDriver` component that subscribes to events from a `XRHandTrackingEvents` and updates a hierarchy of Transforms for each `XRHandJoint`.\n\n### Changed\n- Minimum supported Unity Editor version has changed to 2021.3.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed Hand Visualizer component so it will use another running `XRHandSubsystem` if the first is stopped.\n- Fixed exception in Hand Visualizer component when a joint is invalid.\n- Fixed rendering of lines that connect joints in `HandVisualizer` sample when used with the device simulator. Also removed the Origin property from the component since it was no longer used."
